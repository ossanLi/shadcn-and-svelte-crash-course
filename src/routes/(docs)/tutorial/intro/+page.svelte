what is cn in tailwind-merge?
cn is used to make sure tailwind utils are 
predictable e.g. you want to pass a class
via a prop to a comp but that comp already
has that same class or has a class like
bg-red-500 but you pass bg-blue-500, then 
it isn't predictable on which is going to 
override who so we use class={cn()}

conditionals with cn and {#if} for props

...resetProps for $props lets us add additional props
even if they aren't defined in the actual component

@render children, to render children of that 
comp/sec

barral exports

compound components with svelte
